This is my personalized Vim config.
Note I use [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

To install:
- Must have zsh installed `apt-get install zsh`
- Then run `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charmatski/dotvim/master/install.sh | bash`

Then allow Vim to start and Vundle to install the plugins.
You may have to use `reset` in the terminal afterwards if you find that the text you type is not appearing.
